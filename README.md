Calligrapher
============

A Javascript application to procedurally beautify Chinese calligraphy.

### Calligraphic Beautification

The system takes as user input handwritten Chinese characters, uses a least squared fit
to split each stroke into segments, then applies visual styles based on the orientation
and length of the segments and their neighbors.
